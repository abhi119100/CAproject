PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project implements a comprehensive flight route analysis system that 
solves three complex routing problems using graph algorithms and efficient 
data structures.

ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED:

1. SHORTEST PATH WITH CONNECTION LIMIT (Task 1)
   - Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Purpose: Find shortest route between two cities within connection limit
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Input: routeSearch 1 <city_A> <city_B> <max_connections>
   - Output: Complete route with total connections

2. MULTI-WAYPOINT ROUTING (Task 2)
   - Algorithm: Multiple BFS with path optimization
   - Purpose: Find optimal route through specific intermediate cities
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E) 
   - Input: routeSearch 2 <start> through <city1> and <city2> to <end>
   - Output: Optimal route visiting all waypoints

3. OPTIMAL MEETING POINT (Task 3)
   - Algorithm: BFS from multiple sources with global optimization
   - Purpose: Find city that minimizes total travel for 3 people
   - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
   - Input: routeSearch 3 <city_A> <city_B> <city_C>
   - Output: Meeting city and individual routes

DATA STRUCTURES:

1. GRAPH REPRESENTATION:
   - Adjacency List: vector<vector<int>>
   - Justification: Efficient for sparse graphs (flight networks)
   - Space Complexity: O(V + E)

2. CITY MAPPING:
   - Hash Map: unordered_map<string, int>
   - Purpose: Fast city name to ID conversion
   - Time Complexity: O(1) average lookup

3. PATH RECONSTRUCTION:
   - Parent Array: vector<int>
   - Purpose: Backtrack optimal paths
   - Space Complexity: O(V)

DESIGN DECISIONS:

1. BFS ALGORITHM CHOICE:
   - Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
   - Optimal for flight network analysis (all flights = 1 connection)
   - Better than DFS (no shortest path guarantee)
   - Better than Dijkstra (unnecessary for unweighted graphs)

2. ADJACENCY LIST REPRESENTATION:
   - More memory efficient than adjacency matrix for sparse graphs
   - Faster neighbor iteration
   - Real flight networks are typically sparse

3. PREPROCESSING OPTIMIZATION:
   - Pre-compute BFS from multiple sources (Task 2 & 3)
   - Reduces redundant computation
   - Enables global optimization

PROJECT COMPONENTS:

1. graphGen.exe - Random flight network generator
   - Generates realistic flight connections
   - Configurable city count (1-140)
   - Outputs human-readable format

2. WA.exe - Adjacency matrix display
   - Converts flight data to matrix representation
   - Shows city ID assignments
   - Displays graph connectivity

3. routeSearch.exe - Main routing algorithms
   - Implements all three required tasks
   - Robust error handling
   - Professional output formatting

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Generated multiple graph sizes (15, 25, 50 cities)
- Tested edge cases (unreachable cities, invalid inputs)
- Verified shortest path optimality
- Confirmed meeting point minimization

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
- All algorithms achieve optimal time complexity O(V + E)
- Memory usage scales linearly with graph size
- Handles graphs up to 140 cities efficiently

DELIVERABLES:
1. Source code (graphGen.cpp, WA.cpp, routeSearch.cpp)
2. Compiled executables (Windows compatible)
3. Test data files (city.name, flight.txt)
4. Demonstration script (professor_demo.bat)
